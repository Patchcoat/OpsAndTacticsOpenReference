<text>Purchasing a License  To purchase a license or pay necessary fees, a character pays the fee on the chart, and waits the appropriate time. To expedite the process, the character may attempt a Knowledge (Business) check at the listed TN. Success results in the license being issued in 1d4 days. During character creation, a character only needs to purchase the license or pay the fee; the time required takes place before game play begins, however a character can only purchase a Licensed or Restricted license at character gneeration, unless a GM says otherwise. As a general rule, a character must obtain the appropriate license before buying a restricted object. When a character has purchased the appropriate license once, it is applicable for all items with the same rating, so a character does not have to purchase a license for each item of the same level. A higher license grants the ability to purchase any object at the same restriction level or lower. Legitimate dealers will not sell restricted objects to a character who does not have the necessary license. However, a character may be able to turn to the black market to obtain restricted objects without a license</text>
