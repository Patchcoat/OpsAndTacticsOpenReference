<text>Frequently Asked Questions and Examples of Play88.1 Frequently Asked Questions</text>
</box>
<box>
<text>Answer: Yes, armor does stack. If the DR of one upper armor is does stop the same kind of damage of that was given, the left over damage is transferred to the armor underneath, and that damage goes to the new armor&#x27;s armor point score.</text>
</box>
<box>
<text>Answer: No. Any unspent combat points are lost once the next action, but they must use those points by the end of the round, otherwise they are lost and the point values are reset.</text>
</box>
<box>
<text>Answer: Unless otherwise noted, grenades take a full round to the grenade explodes at the beginning of the turn of the person who originally threw it. </text>
</box>
<box>
<text>Answer: Bleed dice are rolled after the person that is bleeding their turn. They are always rolled after their turn has completed, never before or during, even if they acquired the bleed dice during that turn.</text>
</box>
<box>
<text>Answer: Called shots should be specified before an attack roll is and so that there is no confusion between the GM and the players on what the player is attempting to attack. If you don&#x27;t specify a called shot, it is assumed you are aiming for “Center mass” or the chest-pelvis region.</text>
</box>
<box>
<text>Answer: Usually yes. Any object that isn&#x27;t outright listed to be range, 5 range increments), and is considered a “Brick” for damages. </text>
</box>
<box>
<text>Answer: No, recoil is only increased if the particular ammunition type. If it does not specify that the specified ammunition type increases the caliber recoil penalty, it does not.</text>
</box>
<box>
<text>Answer: No. At the discretion of the GM, If any character or more damage dice than the character has both CHP and XHP combined, the GM can immediately reduce this character or creature&#x27;s XHP and CHP to 0. If a GM does want to apply bleed damage in this case, treat each damage dice as if it rolled the lowest possible value per dice. Also, if any character or creature would be damaged by an attack or action that has more than 2x damage dice than the character or creature has in both CHP and XHP combined, the GM can immediately consider this character dead. Bleed damage is usually unnecessary in this case, but can be applied in the same manner as stated before. If an object or vehicle would be damaged by an attack or action that has more than 2x damage dice than the object or vehicle has in HP, the GM can immediately consider the object destroyed, and blown to pieces.</text>
</box>
<box>
<text>Answer: Sometimes. Increases of Strength, Dexterity, that rely on them or use them to derive a value, such as attack bonuses, damage bonuses, HP, Mental Limit, and their associated ability score skill modifiers. Intelligence does as well, but a player does not gain retroactive skill points for prior levels they did not have when they leveled up, because they did not have that level of intelligence when they leveled up. Going forward, their current Intelligence score would be used, which would result in more skill points. A GM can, however, award these skill points they would have missed, as they see fit.</text>

<text>Henry and Larry are both standing on a street, 30&#x27; away from one handgun that Larry has concealed in his waistband. Larry took 10 to conceal that handgun, so the TN to detect it is 14(10 + 4 Stealth Ranks). Henry rolls a 26 (3d6: 6, 6, 4, +10 Perception) and easily spots the handgun carried in the waistband of Larry. Henry inquires about the handgun he spotted in Larry&#x27;s waistband to Larry, who immediately yells obscenities and threats at Henry. The GM calls the start of combat. Because neither character has surprised the other, there is no surprise round, so both characters roll initiative. Henry rolls a 7 (3d6: 2, 2, 2 +1) and Larry rolls a 3 (3d6: 1, 1, 1, +0).</text>
</box>
<box>
<text>Henry wins the initiative so he goes first. Henry draws his Glock command to put his hands up, reading an action that if Larry makes a move for his waistband, he will immediately take a single shot attack(7 CP - 1 CP for Handgun Specialist Feat = 6 CP cost).</text>
</box>
		<text>   Turn 1, Larry&#x27;s actions</text>
<box>
<text>Larry begins his turn by immediately drawing his handgun from his </text>
</box>
<box>
<text>Larry takes a single shot (7 CP) at Henry with his S&amp;W SD40, firearms have a critical threat range of 16-18 natural roll) , and because it is above the defender&#x27;s defense of 13, the attack is successful. Because it is a critical strike, the attack ignores armor and Extended Hit Points, going straight to Henry&#x27;s Core Hit Points. Larry rolls his damage, rolling a 10(3d4: 4, 3, 3), and does 10 ballistic damage to Henry&#x27;s Core Hit Points, leaving him with 5. Because it bypassed his armor, Henry now has 3 bleed damage and will take 3d3 bleed dice at the end of his turn. </text>
</box>
<box>
<text>At the end of his turn, Larry rolls his bleed dice, receiving 7 HP first, leaving him with with 2 Extended HP.</text>
</box>
<box>
<text>Henry immediately returns fire at Larry, performing a Double Tap Henry&#x27;s 14 Strength Score (+4 to recoil) mostly offsets the -5 Caliber Recoil penalty( -3 + -2 for 9x19mm), giving the attack a -1 total penalty. Henry rolls his attack, rolling a 14(3d6: 5, 2, 5, +3 -1 Recoil), and successfully attacks Larry. Because 9x19mm has 2 or less damage dice as standard (2d6), it gains +1 damage dice. Henry rolls his damage, rolling 12 (3d6:2,3,5, +2 for unarmored due to JHPs), and does 12 ballistic damage to Larry.</text>
</box>
<box>
<text>Henry performs another Double Tap Attack (5CP) at Larry, rolling again. Henry rolls his damage, rolling 11 (3d6: 4, 4, 1, +2 for unarmored due to JHPs), and does 11 ballistic damage to Larry. Larry is now at -4 Core HP, and falls unconscious immediately. He also receives 3 more bleed damage, bringing his total bleed damage to 11. </text>
</box>
<box>
<text>At the end of his turn, Henry rolls his bleed dice, receiving 5 first, leaving him with with 11 Extended HP.</text>
</box>
<box>
<text>Larry is currently unconscious, at -4 Core Hit Points. He first 15(3d6: 4, 6, 1, +4), which is less than the TN20 required to stabilize. For this, he loses 1 Core Hit Point, putting him at -5. Because he is unable to stabilize himself, his turn ends. </text>

<text>John and Bruce are both standing in a field, 30&#x27; away from one is standing with his arms crossed. John takes a single 5&#x27; step towards Bruce, which prompts Bruce to grasp and ready his spear. They are standing 25&#x27; away from one another now. The GM calls the start of combat. Because neither character has surprised the other, there is no surprise round, so both characters roll initiative. Bruce rolls a 9 (3d6: 2, 4, 2 +1) and John rolls a 10 (3d6: 1, 6, 1, +2).</text>
</box>
<box>
<text>John immediately draws his shortsword (3 CP) and advances 15&#x27; (3 cost) toward Bruce. John is currently in Bruce&#x27;s threatened square, as he is standing 10&#x27; away from Bruce. Because he started out of a threatened square </text>
</box>
<box>
<text>Bruce makes his Attack of Opportunity, rolling a 14 (3d6: 4,2,6, receives 5 (2d4: 3,1,+1) piercing damage. John is wearing a leather vest, which protects him from 2 of the piercing damage. His armor loses 2 Armor Points, leaving him with 6 Armor Points left, and he takes 3 points to his Extended Hit points, leaving him with 12. He does not take any bleed damage as he was wearing armor that protected him from the damage he received.</text>
</box>
<box>
<text>John swings his sword a second time, choosing to swing lightly(3 reduced cost. He rolls a 14 (3d6: 5, 5, 1, +3) for his attack, striking Bruce again. He rolls his damage, getting 4 (1d6: 6, -2), and applying this to Bruce&#x27;s Core Hit Points now. Bruce takes 4 damage to his Core Hit Points, leaving him with 8 Core Hit points. Bruce also takes an additional 1 bleed damage, for a total of 3 now.</text>

</box>
<box>
<text>Bruce attacks again, forgoing targeting John&#x27;s arm and makes a (3d6: 6, 1, 4, +2). John&#x27;s defense is also 13, and defenders always win ties, so Bruce barely misses John with his attack. </text>
</box>
<box>
<text>At the end of his turn, Bruce rolls his bleed dice, receiving 5 Points, leaving him with with 3 Core Hit points.</text>
