        <text>   A character will rarely keep one job their entire life. When changing jobs, the character first loses their current job, and becomes unemployed for at least two weeks, relinquishing their old salary. Then, if a character meets the requirements to enter their new job, they enter it, and pick from the skills listed, and receive the new job's biweekly salary from now on. They do not select any of the bonus feats for the job, when entering it. They must meet both the starting requirements, and the job change requirements, in order to qualify for the job.</text>
