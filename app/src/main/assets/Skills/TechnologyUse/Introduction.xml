        <header>Technology Use (INT)</header>
        <text>   Your character is skilled at using computers and technology to bypass security systems, destroy and create programs.</text>
        <text>   Most normal computer operations don't require a Technology Use check. However, searching an unfamiliar network for a particular file, writing computer programs, altering existing programs to perform differently (better or worse), and breaking through computer security are all relatively difficult and require skill checks. A character without a computer (either a laptop or desktop) cannot use Technology Use.
