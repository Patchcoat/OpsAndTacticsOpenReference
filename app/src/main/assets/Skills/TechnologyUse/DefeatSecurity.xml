        <text>  This application of Technology Use can't be used untrained. The TN is determined by the quality of the security program installed to defend the system. If the check is failed by 5 or more, the security system immediately alerts its administrator that there has been an unauthorized entry. An alerted administrator may attempt to identify the character or cut off the character's access to the system.</text>
        <text>  â€ƒSometimes, when accessing a difficult site, the character has to defeat security at more than one stage of the operation. If the character beats the TN by 10 or more when attempting to defeat computer security, the character automatically succeeds at all subsequent security checks at that site until the end of the character's session (see Computer Hacking below).
