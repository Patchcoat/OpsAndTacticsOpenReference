        <text>   This skill allows a character to speak, read, and write a language. The Linguistics skill doesn't work like a standard skill.

            <text>A character automatically knows how to read and write their native language; the character does not need ranks to do so.</text>
            <text>To read, write and speak a language costs 1 rank.</text>
            <text>A character never makes Linguistics checks. A character either knows how to read and write a specific language or doesn't.</text>
            <text>A character may choose any language, modern or ancient. The GM may rule that a character can't learn a specific language due to the circumstances of the campaign.</text>

        <header level="1">Language Groups</header>
        <text>   There are thousands of languages to choose from when a character buys ranks in Linguistics. A few are listed here, sorted into their general language groups. A language's group doesn't matter when a character is buying ranks in Linguistics. This list is by no means exhaustiveâ€”there are many more language groups and most groups contain more languages than those listed here.
