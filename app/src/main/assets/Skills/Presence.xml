        <header>Presence (CHA)</header>
        <text>   The character is skilled at threatening and persuading others, feinting in battle, and changing their appearance.
        </text>
        <header level="1">Feint</header>
        <text>   You can use Presence to try to and mislead an opponent in melee combat so that he can't dodge your next attack effectively, called feinting. To feint, make a Presence check opposed by another presence check by your target. The target may add his BAB to this Presence check. If your perception check result exceeds your target's check result, the next melee attack you make against the target does not allow him to use his DEX bonus to DEF (if any). This attack must be made on or before your next turn. Attempting to feint against a creature of animal intelligence (1 or 2), is at a −4 penalty. Attempting to feint against a non-intelligent creature is impossible. Feinting in combat does not provoke AoO.
        </text>
        <header level="1">Disguise</header>
        <text>   You can also use Presence to disguise your appearance. Your Presence check result determines how good the disguise is, and it is opposed by others' Perception check results. If you don't draw any attention to yourself, others do not get to make Perception checks. If you come to the attention of people who are suspicious (such as a security guard who is observing people), it can be assumed that such observers are taking 10 on their Perception checks.</text>
        <text>   You get only one Presence check per use of the skill, even if several people are making Perception checks against it.</text>
        <text>   The Disguise check is made secretly, so that you can't be sure how good the result is.</text>
        <text>   The effectiveness of your disguise depends in part on how much you're attempting to change your appearance, and any behavior associated with it.

        <text>   After the intimidate expires, the target treats you as unfriendly and may report you to local authorities. If you fail this check by 5 or more, the target attempts to deceive you or otherwise hinder your activities. The Speechcraft skill may also be used for intimidation.

        <text><b>Special</b></text>
        <text>   A character without a disguise kit takes a −6 penalty on presence checks to disguise themselves.
        </text>
        <text><b>Time</b></text>
        <text>   To influence a creature's attitude takes 1 minute of continuous interaction. To change an opponent's attitude by intimidating them requires 1 minute of conversation. Making a request of a creature takes 1 or more rounds of interaction, depending upon the complexity of the request. Disguising oneself requires 1d4×10 minutes of preparation. Feinting and Terrifying takes 8 CP.
        </text>
        <text><b>Try Again?</b></text>
        <text>   You can attempt to feint against someone again if you fail. You may try to redo a failed disguise, but once others know that a disguise was attempted they'll be more suspicious. You can attempt to intimidate or terrify an opponent again, but each additional check increases the TN by +5. This increase resets after one hour has passed.
