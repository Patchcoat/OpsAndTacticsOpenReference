<text>Linguistics (None) Trained Only  This skill allows a character to speak, read, and write a language. The Linguistics skill doesn&#x27;t work like a standard skill.</text>
</box>
<list type="unordered">
<text>To read, write and speak a language costs 1 rank.</text>
<text>A character never makes Linguistics checks. A character either knows how to read and write a specific language or doesn&#x27;t.</text>
<text>A character may choose any language, modern or ancient. The GM may rule that a character can&#x27;t learn a specific language due to the circumstances of the campaign.</text>
</list>

This list is by no means exhaustiveâ€”there are many more language groups and most groups contain more languages than those listed here.</text>
