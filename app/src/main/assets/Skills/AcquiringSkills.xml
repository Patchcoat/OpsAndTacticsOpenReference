        <text>   At each level, a character gets skill points that are used to buy skills. How much COP a character spends and INT modifier determine the number of points received. If the character buys a focused skill, they get 1 rank in the skill for each skill point spent. If the character buys a unfocused skill, they get Â½ rank per skill point. The rules assume that a character can always find a way to learn any skill. However, the GM may impose limits depending on the circumstances.</text>
