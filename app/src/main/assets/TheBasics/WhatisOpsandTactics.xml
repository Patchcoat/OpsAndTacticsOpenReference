<text>What is Ops and Tactics?  Ops and Tactics is a tabletop role playing game focused around believable combat encounters, with an emphasis on modern weapons and equipment. Combat is in-depth and allows for more fluid sequences of actions based around a system where players spend chunks of time every round to build their turns out of individual actions, packing each round with more choices and activity. Taking inspirations from video games such as classic XCOM, Metal Gear Solid, and Jagged Alliance, and films such as John Wick, Heat and The Town, each round is also more dangerous as a result a single bullet in the right place can end a fight as soon as it starts. A very extensive equipment and firearm list, with gun capabilities modeled after their real-world abilities lets you stat up and run just about any combatant you can think of. Batons, tasers, anachronistic melee weapons like swords and flamethrowers, and hundreds guns ranging from the wild west to the standard-issue of today and more make it possible, and spoil you for choice. If that&#x27;s not enough, the crafting rules allow for an industrious character to fabricate entirely new firearms from scratch, from simple zipguns to elaborate custom race guns, and even make their own customized ammunition to go along with their fabricated firearms. Ops and Tactics is focused on modern combat, and is suited for running games set in a world similar to our own with an emphasis on combat and action.</text>
