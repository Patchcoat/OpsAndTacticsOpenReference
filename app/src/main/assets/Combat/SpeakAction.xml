<text>Speak Action  With the exception of specific speaking-related abilities, speaking doesn&#x27;t cost any Combat Points. Speaking allows the character convey 6 seconds of information, which is about 15 words. These words can be conveyed in any language the character can speak. Characters can also make any noises that they wish to produce and that their vocal cords can handle.</text>
