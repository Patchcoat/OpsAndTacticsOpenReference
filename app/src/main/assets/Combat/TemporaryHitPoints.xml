<text>Temporary Hit Points  Certain effects can give a character temporary HP. When a character gains temporary HP make a note of their current HP before adding the temporary HP. When the temporary HP goes away, the character&#x27;s HP drop to that score. If the character&#x27;s HP are already below that score, all the temporary HP have already been lost and the character&#x27;s HP total does not drop. When temporary HP are lost, they can&#x27;t be restored as real HP can be, even with medical treatment.</text>
