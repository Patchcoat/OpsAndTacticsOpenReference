            <header>Standard Issue Vs. Player’s Choice</header>
            <text>Choosing a sidearm can be an arduous choice. There are many things to be considered, such as caliber, capacity, and upgrade points, as well as cost. A good alternative to this to have the GM select a firearm as a standard issue sidearm for the police force. This guarantees uniformity in magazines, spare parts, and ammunition, as well as familiarity. Popular firearms include the Glock 17, Glock 19, Glock 22, Glock 23, Beretta 92FS, Smith and Wesson M&amp;P, and Springfield Armory GI 1911A1.</text>
