        <text>   To rear an animal means to raise a wild creature from infancy so that it becomes domesticated. A handler can rear as many as three creatures of the same kind at once.</text>
        <text>   A successfully domesticated animal can be taught tricks at the same time it is being raised or it can be taught as a domesticated animal later.</text>
        <text><b>Try Again?</b></text>
        <text>Yes, except for rearing an animal.</text>
        <text><b>Time</b></text>
        <text>Varies. Handling an animal costs 6 CP, while pushing an animal is 12 CP. For tasks with specific time frames noted above, you must spend half this time (at the rate of 3 hours per day per animal being handled) working toward completion of the task before you attempt the Animal Handling check. If the check fails, your attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal fails and you need not complete the teaching, rearing, or training time. If the check succeeds, you must invest the remainder of the time to complete the teaching, rearing, or training. If the time is interrupted or the task is not followed through to completion, the attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal automatically fails.</text>
