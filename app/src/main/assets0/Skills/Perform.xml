        <text><b>Special</b></text>
        <text>   A character can take 10 when making a Perform check.</text>
        <text>   A character without an appropriate instrument automatically fails any Perform (Keyboard), Perform (Percussion), Perform (Stringed), or Perform (Wind) check they attempt. At the GM's discretion, impromptu instruments may be employed, but the performer must take a −6 penalty on the check because their equipment, although usable, is inappropriate for the skill.
        </text>
        <text><b>Try Again?</b></text>
        <text>   Not for the same performance and audience.
        </text>
        <text><b>Time</b></text>
        <text>   A Perform check usually requires at least several minutes to an hour or more.
