        <text>   The character is trained how to drive in unusual circumstances, such as inclement weather, or during a dramatic situation, such as being chased, or attempting to reach a location quickly. A character does not need any ranks in drive in order to drive a civilian car, truck, or motorcycle. When driving, the character can attempt simple maneuvers or stunts.
