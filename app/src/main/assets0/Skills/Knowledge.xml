        <header>Knowledge (INT) Trained Only</header>
        <text>   This skill allows a character to be knowledgeable in a particular area of lore.</text>
        <text>  A character makes a Knowledge check to see if the character knows something. When trying to determine what Knowledge skill a particular question or field of expertise falls under, use a broad interpretation of the existing categories. When answering a question, the TN for answering within the character's field of study varies by the difficulty of the question asked.</text>
        <text>  Knowledge checks can also be used to create opportunities that would otherwise not exist, if the character was not knowledgeable in the area.

        <text><b>Special</b></text>
        <text>   An untrained Knowledge check is simply an INT check. Without actual training, a character only knows common knowledge about a given subject.</text>
        <text>   A character can take 10 when making a Knowledge check.</text>
        <text>   Certain Knowledge skills give synergy bonuses to other skills.
        </text>
        <text><b>Try Again?</b></text>
        <text>   No. The check represents what a character knows and thinking about a topic a second time doesn't let the character know something they never knew in the first place.
        </text>
        <text><b>Time</b></text>
        <text>   A Knowledge check can be a reaction, but otherwise costs 12 CP.
