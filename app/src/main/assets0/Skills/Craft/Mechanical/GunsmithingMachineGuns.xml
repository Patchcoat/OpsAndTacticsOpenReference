        <text>   Light Machine Guns are machine guns that fire an intermediate rifle cartridge, usually from a belt or a high capacity Magazine. They are almost always equipped with bipods and stocks, to help steady the firearm in its automatic fire. Because of their intended use, they rarely have a semi-automatic rate of fire. Their ranges can vary, but are generally between 80-120'. When crafting a weapon with automatic fire, the creator can choose what rate of fire the automatic fires at.

        <text>1 A character can choose to craft a firearm to take the same kind of magazines from a preexisting Marksman Rifles. If the character does this, they do not have to add the TN to the firearm's total level, but the firearm must use the same caliber of ammunition that the corresponding magazine and firearm uses. A character can also choose to have a Light Machine Gun accept magazines as well as linked ammunition. This increases the TN by 10.</text>
