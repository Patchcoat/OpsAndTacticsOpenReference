        <text>   Most repair checks are made to fix complex or advanced mechanical devices. The TN is set by the GM. In general, simple repairs have a TN of 10 to 15 and require no more than a few minutes to accomplish. More complex repair work has a TN of 20 or higher and can require an hour or more to complete. Making repairs also involves a monetary cost when spare parts or new components are needed, represented by either buying or procuring them. If the GM decides this isn't necessary for the type of repair the character is attempting, then the parts are not required.</text>
        <text>   A character can choose to attempt to jury-rig, or make temporary repairs. Doing this reduces the repair check TN by 5, and allows the character to make the checks for 12 CP. However, a jury-rigged repair can only fix a single problem with a check, and the temporary repair only lasts until the end of the current scene or encounter. The jury-rigged object must be fully repaired thereafter.</text>
        <text>   A character can also jury-rig and hot-wire a car or jump-start an engine. The TN for this is at least 15, and it can be higher depending on the presence of security devices.
